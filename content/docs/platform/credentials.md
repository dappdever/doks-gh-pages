Credentials, also known as badges, are artifacts or designations that can be assigned to a member. 

Similar to a role, badges are defined as an abstract document with an image, description, and optional payment coefficients. The badge is added to the 'badge library' and becomes available to be assigned to individual members.

### Coefficients
The payment coefficients are used to juice a badge holder's pay on both salaries and one-time payments. Coefficients are compatible with any of your token types, governance, reward, or pegs.

Coeffecients may also be negative in order to handicap or penalize a member's token balance.

### Powers
Badges can exist just for bragging rights or it may come with special powers.

### Badge Expiration
When badges are assigned, they may optionally come with a specific duration or time period of effectivity.

### Assignment
Badges can be configured to be assignable by a single person, the approval of a governance vote, or based on certain pre-defined rules enforced by the blockchain.

### Default Library
Our default library contains the following badges:
- Enroller - admits applicants to the organization
- Treasurer - multisignature authority on the cross-chain treasuries
- Facilitator - this badge holder is trusted to run calls, ensuring fair participation and on-time wrap up
- Moderator
- Lamp Lighter
