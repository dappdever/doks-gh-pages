The platform supports classic double-entry accounting in the same manner as many accounting packages used by businesses all over the world, including Quickbooks, NetSuite, ledger, GnuCash, and SAP.

Our implementation and support for double-entry accounting is a significant advantage when compared to other blockchain-powered organization platforms.

### Double Entry Ledgers
Double entry booking has been the accounting best practice used for centuries. It is used by nearly all businesses, from a small one-person consultancy to public traded corporations.

In many jurisdictions, tax compliance regulations require companies to use double-entry accounting. Among many other benefits, it enables the support of balance sheets and income statements.

### Balance Sheet
A balance sheet report shows an organization's assets, liabilities, and equity. It includes ledger accounts such as ```accounts payable``` (funds owed by the organization to another organization), ```accounts receivable``` (funds owned to the organization), treasury amounts, and other assets such as intellectual property, inventory, and equipment.

Balance sheets are a point-in-time snapshot of the organization's financial landscape.

Here's an example view of a balance sheet

### Income Statement
An income statement report shows an organization's financial performance over a period of time, such as a quarter or year. 

It shows the organization's revenue compared to expenses. It includes ledger accounts such as ```cloud services```, ```salaries```, and ```sales```.
