## Role proposals
A role proposal includes the following data:
- Title
- Description
- Salary amounts (per period, per token)
- Available dates (begin and end)
- Minimum commitment (e.g. no less than a 50% commitment)
- Available slots (1 person budgeted? or many?)

When a role is approved, it becomes available for members to apply for.
