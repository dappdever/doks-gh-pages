The National Cooperative Business Association CLUSA International (NCBA CLUSA) has worked for more than 100 years to build a better world and a more inclusive economy. We engage, partner with and empower people to have a greater say in their futures and more equitable access to economic opportunities.

NCBA CLUSA speaks with a united voice before elected officials, raising awareness of the cooperative economic impact and advocating for federal policies that benefit cooperative enterpriseâ€”like access to the critical financing and technical assistance communities need to establish and grow employee-owned businesses.

The NCBA has adopted the platform of choice for cooperatives around the world. The innovative platform enables cooperatives and sovereign organizations to operate a manner that encourages trust in elections and transparent operations.

   "The NCBA CLUSA represents a strategic partnership 
   for us. With their support, we intend to scale the 
   platform to serve as a best-of-breed application for 
   cooperatives. The NCBA CLUSA provides over 100 years 
   of experience, and we plan to codify the operational 
   and governance best practices drawn from their 
   deep knowledge."  
               -- Max Gravitt, Architect

The NCBA CLUSA has over 20 active projects in the Americas, Africa, and Indonesia.
