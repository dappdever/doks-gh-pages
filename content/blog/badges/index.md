An initial set of badges are now available.

These include:
- Treasurer 
- Facilitator
- Enroller

The badge rewards vary from 0% to 5% and also vary depending on the token.  For example, a Treasurer badge holder receives a 3% bonus on HYPHA payments and a Lamp Lighter receives a 5% bonus on HVOICE.

Badges will be shown on the member card.
