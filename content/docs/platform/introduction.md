### Tokens

Tokens represent a core component of managing your team. You configure your own token to be used for voting and financial rewards. It can be a single token, or you can create multiple tokens that are used for different purposes. To get started, we recommend a non-transferable token for voting and a transferable token for rewards.

### Roles and Projects

Post roles and projects with clear descriptions so members can find work, and reward them with recurring salaries or one-time bounties.

## Badges

Award badges to members for performing a certain duty, holding an authority, completion of training, or for showing off their achievements.

Badges can optionally include extra kickers on top of members' salary or project pay.

## Identity and Membership

We use account names instead of cryptic public keys. Members can establish an off-chain profile (GDPR compliant), and for those you may have never met, our social media proof guarantees that the person on your team is the same person they claim to be on LinkedIn, Twitter, Github, or other common social media sites.

## Proven Reporting

Blockchain reports are typically esoteric, hard to read, and completely foreign to career accountants. They aren't very good at monitoring business performance either. The platform supports time-tested double-entry accounting, with easy-to-use income statements, balance sheets, and budgets. Anyone who has used Quickbooks, NetSuite or SAP will feel right at home.

## Web & Mobile

Our beautiful user interfaces eliminate the intimidating and confusing experience of typical blockchain applications and block explorers.

## Treasury

Accept donations and investments from the community in a trustless, decentralized manner using bitcoin, Ethereum, or other common cryptocurrencies. Optionally listing your token on the exchange provides automated liquidity. 

Native support for cross-chain multisignature allows you to establish an executive or financial committee responsible for handling your treasury.
