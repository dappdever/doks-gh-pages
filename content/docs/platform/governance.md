The platform supports a wide variety of voting methods and evaluation criteria.

## Voting Methods
- Cumulative voting
- Ranked choice voting
- Consensus voting
- Majority rules
- Super majority
- Variable quorum based on controversy
- Stake voting
- Elections
- One token, one vote
- One person, one vote

## Tokens
Voting power may be set to a single token or combination of tokens.

## Vote Power Decay
If you select a non-transferable token to represent voting power, you may also optionally specify a decay algorithm. For example, voting power may be automatically reduced by 1% for each token holder, each week.

Decaying voting power serves to give more influence to members that are more active (earning vote tokens) recently.  It helps to keep ideas fresh and your organization moving forward.  Sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes is does not. 

## Default Behavior
Although every organization differs, we have found this works well for many teams:
- Non-transferable voting token that is earned (VOICE token)
- Quorum of 20% for to pass a proposal
- Proposal approval of 67% to pass
